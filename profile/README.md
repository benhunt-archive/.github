## Hi, I’m Ben (currently: @Bdhgit33)

**What you’ll find here:** personal Unity game development projects (portfolio + learning).

**Current focus:** I’m archiving my Unity work to concentrate on **AI Engineering** and **software development** as my primary career direction (including upcoming bootcamp projects).

Game dev remains a genuine interest, and I may revisit these repositories later to iterate or build something just for fun.
