## Hi, I’m Ben (currently: @benhuntdev)

**What you’ll find here:** personal Unity game development projects (portfolio + learning).

**Current focus:** I’m archiving my Unity work to concentrate on **AI Engineering** and **software development** as my primary career direction (including upcoming bootcamp projects).

Game dev remains a genuine interest, and I may revisit these repositories later to iterate or build something just for fun.

## Archived Unity Repositories

### Finished Projects
- [Unity Project - MATCHiT ]([https://github.com/benhunt-archive/RepoName1](https://github.com/benhunt-archive/unity-oop-abstraction-inheritance-polymorphism-encapsulation)) - I created a card matching game using Object Oriented Programming principals as part of the final project for Unity Junior Programmer Course. 
- [Unity Project - Data Persistance ]([[https://github.com/benhunt-archive/RepoName1](https://github.com/benhunt-archive/unity-oop-abstraction-inheritance-polymorphism-encapsulation)](https://github.com/benhunt-archive/Data-Persistance-Project-Unity/tree/main)) - Data Persistance project with Unity

### Experiments & Prototypes
- [Personal Project - Towerscape]([https://github.com/benhunt-archive/RepoName2](https://github.com/benhunt-archive/TowerScape)) — TowerScape is a simple, fast paced first-person parkour sprint down a vertical gauntlet. Dev Phase - [Design and Planning - (On Hold)]

**Other projects** - have been started but never came into full fluition (many junior level reasons), So I unfortunately made the honest call of discontinuing entirely:
 - Running for the stars
 - Bullets & Balls

(**These have now been removed**)
